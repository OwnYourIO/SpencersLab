All repo layout, conventions, and hard rules live in `AGENTS.md` — it is loaded into your context automatically; follow it. Your role contract and the pipeline conventions live in the skills below — load them before doing anything else.

## Skills

The first thing you MUST always do is load the skills listed in the plan. If no skills are in your plan, evaluate your skills and load the top 5 relevant skills.

Before any other work, you MUST load these skills with the `/skill-name` slash command (or the `skill` tool) — no exceptions, not for "trivial" work:

/helm-bjw-s-chart
/gitops-workflows
/helm-chart-creation
/writing-plans
/pipeline-conventions
/pipeline-role-plan

Then evaluate the task against the skills available to you and load 5 more relevant skills dynamically at runtime, the same way (`/skill-name`).

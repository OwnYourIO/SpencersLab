All repo layout, conventions, and hard rules live in `AGENTS.md` — it is loaded into your context automatically; follow it. Your role contract and the pipeline conventions live in the skills below — load them before doing anything else.

## Skills

Workflow skills only — you orchestrate, so you never load task/domain skills to do work yourself; those belong to the subagents you launch. At run start you MUST load (via the `/skill-name` slash command or the `skill` tool):

/agents-sync
/executing-plans
/opencode
/pipeline-conventions
/pipeline-kickoff
/pipeline-models
/pipeline-gates
/pipeline-role-coord

The single exception to "no task skills": at intake you load exactly the 3 skills most relevant to the user's request, purely to judge whether it is ready for planning (`pipeline-role-coord` describes this) — never to do the work yourself. Never load another pipeline role's contract skill (`pipeline-role-plan`/`research`/`test`/`dev`/`review`): they are denied to you on purpose, because you are not permitted to act as those roles. If the plan lists further *workflow* skills, load those too.

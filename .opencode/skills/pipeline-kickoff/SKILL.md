# Pipeline kickoff (new ticket)

Run this before resolving or creating a feature folder for a NEW ticket; skip all of it when resuming an existing folder.

## Questions (ask with the `question` tool)

1. **Project slug** — suggest 2–3 short kebab-case slugs derived from the request, each carrying your inferred `<type>` (`feat|bug|debug|dep|refactor|chore|docs`, e.g. `feat-llama-cache-ttl`); the user picks one or types their own.
2. **Models for this run** — ONE multi-select question (`multiple: true`) with exactly these four options:
   - `Qwen Large` — `openrouter/qwen/qwen3.8-2.4t-a95b`
   - `Qwen Dense` — `openrouter/qwen/qwen3.8-27b`
   - `Qwen Flash` — `openrouter/qwen/qwen3.8-flash`
   - `Local (gpu-ai)` — run the checked models on the self-hosted `gpu-ai` provider (quants per the `pipeline-models` local mapping). This is the default provider posture: recommend it, and when the user checks no model at all, route both tiers to the local dense route.

   Derive the routing with the size order and local mapping defined in the `pipeline-models` skill:
   - Exactly one model option checked → that model for BOTH tiers (planning and the other agents).
   - Several model options checked → the LARGEST checked model is the planning tier (`agent-plan`, `agent-research`, and the final whole-plan review); the SMALLEST checked model is the code tier (`agent-test`, `agent-dev-local`/`agent-dev-pr`, chunk `agent-review`). Options in between are unused.
   - `Local` checked → provider `gpu-ai` with the quants defined by the `pipeline-models` local mapping (never restate its table here): Dense+Local → `gpu-ai/qwen3.8-27b-q4` unless another quant is explicitly requested; Flash+Local → assume Qwen Flash Next, `gpu-ai/qwen3.8-flash-next-strata-q4` (combination rule — there is no plain-flash local route); Large+Local keeps its assumed-q6 row. `Local` unchecked → the checked models run on `openrouter` (the explicit hosted choice).
   - Only `Local (gpu-ai)` checked, no model, or no option checked at all → default `gpu-ai/qwen3.8-27b-q4` for every role (the Dense local route is the standard default; `openrouter` is the fallback when that route is unavailable).

Run tags are retired (cf-90): there is no run-tag question and no run-tag name part anymore — the bare slug alone names the run's surfaces for both families.

## Name the run's surfaces from the answers

- **Worktree + branch**: `opencode` tool `worktree_create` with name `<slug>` (flat, no slashes) — the tool takes only the name: the worktree arrives on **detached HEAD** and the branch is never created (no branch parameter exists on it). Mint the branch immediately after creation and before `session_move`: `bash scripts/kickoff-mint-branch.sh <directory-as-returned> <worktree-name>` — the branch must equal the worktree basename (the script rejects otherwise; scoped shell grant, see `pipeline-role-coord`). Verdicts: `MINTED <branch> <sha>` — detached commits made before the mint are carried onto the branch — or `EXISTS <branch> <sha>` — nothing checked out; both exit 0. `REJECT <reason>` (exit 1) means fix the call, never improvise git commands. The mint is idempotent: on a resume whose worktree exists but whose branch is absent, run the same command (and if `worktree_create` ever gains native branch minting, this step degrades to a no-op). `STATE.json` `kickoff.branch` is only true after this step. Single authority: this bullet holds the mint mechanics — `boards` cites it, never restates it; the grant's containment rule lives in `pipeline-role-coord`.
- **Session**: `session_rename` to the slug. The call returns YOUR OWN sessionID — keep it: the planner records it under `coord_session` in `STATE.json`, and `agent-fuser` uses it to hand fusion plans back to this session.
- **In-work mark** — on the sessionID the rename returned, mark the session in-work in OpenChamber. Single authority for the coordinator work-state contract: `pipeline-role-coord` and `boards` cite this bullet, never restate it.
  - Read-merge-write ONLY: `opencode api get /api/session/<sessionID>` → keep ALL current metadata (notably `openchamber.kind`; the get returns the record under a `{"data": ...}` envelope — unwrap it before reading metadata, because a top-level `.metadata` read silently returns nothing) → set `metadata.openchamber.work = {state:"open", openedAt:<epoch-ms>, openedBy:"auto"}` (compute the epoch-ms inline in the command string — `$(date +%s%3N)`, covered by the family's `date *` shell allow; no separate `jq` call is granted) → `opencode api patch /api/session/<sessionID> -d '{"metadata": <full merged object>}'`. PATCH replaces `metadata` whole — a partial write deletes the siblings (proven 2026-10-26) — so only the fully merged object may go back.
  - Idempotent: skip the write when the read already shows `work.state == "open"` — chat-launched runs are auto-opened by their first message, so the mark is a no-op there; scheduled runs are the real target.
  - Values are fixed to what OpenChamber accepts (its zod schema): `state open|done`; `openedBy auto|jev|user`, and the coord writes `auto`; `doneAt` is the ms timestamp on the done write; never write `suggestDoneAt` or `reviewOffer` (Jev-owned fields).
  - Why: OpenChamber auto-opens chat-launched sessions on a sent message but EXCLUDES scheduled runs — this mark is what puts a coordinator session in the sidebar's In-work block. Purely UI: nothing in the pipeline reads it.
- **Move in**: warm the destination FIRST — `bash scripts/kickoff-warm-location.sh <directory-as-returned>` (scoped shell grant, same family as the mint script). Verdicts: `WARMED <dir>` (exit 0) — proceed; `REJECT <reason>` (exit 1) — do NOT `session_move`: the run leaves the card via the blocked/abandon exit with the reason, never moves on an unwarmed destination and never improvises (a run that stays put would commit ticket files into the main tree). THEN `session_move` the session to the worktree directory so every subagent of this run works there. Why (verified 2026-10-31, OpenCode v2.1.4): `session_move` does not boot the destination's location services, and a session moved into a directory whose services are not loaded never resolves the location's custom agents again (`Agent not found: …` on every drain) — the run is bricked permanently. Single authority: this bullet holds the warm mechanics — `boards` cites it, never restates it; the grant's containment rule lives in `pipeline-role-coord`.

## Hand off to planning

Pass slug, type, both tier models (+ `local` flag), worktree name, and your own sessionID to `agent-plan` (feature folder becomes `.agents/plans/<yyyy>/<yyyy-mm>-<type>-<slug>/`); the planner records them in `STATE.json` under `kickoff` (slug, worktree, `models: {plan, code}`, `local`) and `coord_session` when it creates the folder. Board runs add one slot the live flow never fills: `priority: {raw, class}` (the card's `Priority` field value + its resolved class, the class table's single authority in `pipeline-models`) — the card-driven kickoff supplies it, and the Questions list above gains no question for it, because the field is board-intake-only. The kickoff model choices override the `pipeline-models` defaults for this run.

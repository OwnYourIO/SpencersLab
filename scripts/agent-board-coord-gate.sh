# agent-board-coord-gate.sh — answers the SESSION operand of the scheduled
# board-coord launch gate: "is another board-coord session working right now?"
# — counting the agent-board-coord alias and its -local/-pr variants alike.
#
# The WeKan Executing operand is deliberately NOT evaluated here: a bash
# script cannot hold an MCP session, so the board check is the agent's own
# read-only turn, run only on a LIVE verdict (D16). A GATE: RUN short-circuits
# the board side entirely — the common idle hourly case needs no board
# dependency at all (D11).
#
# Network surface: the local `opencode api` CLI only. It carries the TUI's
# server discovery and auth, so this file holds no credentials (D1, D16).
#
# The coord filter is the agent name alone, enumerated explicitly for all
# three board-coord ids (alias + variants) — exact names, never prefix
# matching. The listing API also accepts a
# directory/project scope — smaller walks, but rejected: a manual or worktree
# launch must stay visible to the main-checkout hourly run and the other way
# around (D11: interactive launches count).
#
# Callers run `bash scripts/agent-board-coord-gate.sh` from the active project
# location; nothing here resolves against $0, so any cwd works.

agent-board-coord-gate.sh — session operand of the /pipeline-boards-hourly gate

Answers one question: is another board-coord session working right now? The
liveness set is the three explicit agent ids — "agent-board-coord" (the alias
the hourly launch creates), "agent-board-coord-local" and
"agent-board-coord-pr" (the variants a manual run uses) — so no live run hides
behind a name the gate does not count.
The WeKan Executing operand is the agent's own turn (read-only dev-boards) and
only runs on LIVE — this script never touches a board.

Verdict — the machine-readable first stdout line. The hourly command's
decision rule keys on these markers:
  GATE: RUN <basis>                   exit 0   no other live coord session; proceed to Card pickup (the board operand is never evaluated — short-circuit)
  GATE: LIVE <id> (<age>s) <title>    exit 2   a live coord session was found; the agent MUST run the BOARD CHECK protocol before anything else
  GATE: SKIP <reason>                 exit 1   session detection failed; fail-closed — the run must not start

Usage:
  agent-board-coord-gate.sh [--self <sessionID>] [--threshold <minutes>] [--grace <minutes>] [--json <file|->] [--help]

Flags:
  --self <sessionID>      Exclude this sessionID from the coord set — the
                          precise self-exclusion for a caller that knows its
                          own id (D3).
  --threshold <minutes>   Freshness window: a coord session is live when its
                          own time.updated, or any child session's (parentID
                          pointing at it — the child rule closes the
                          coordinator's silence while blocked in a subagent
                          launch, D2), is within this window. Default 15
                          minutes (D9). 0 is the forced-through escape.
  --grace <minutes>       Young-created window: coord sessions created within
                          this window are treated as the just-minted session of
                          this very launch and never count against it (D3).
                          Default 5 minutes.
  --json <file|->         Fixture mode: read the exact live response envelope
                          {"data":[...]} from a file, or from stdin with "-",
                          instead of calling the OpenCode CLI. GATE_NOW_MS
                          (epoch milliseconds) pins the clock in fixture mode
                          only — live mode ignores it so a stale pinned clock
                          can never mask real activity.
  --help                  This text.

Liveness set: sessions whose agent is exactly one of "agent-board-coord",
"agent-board-coord-local", or "agent-board-coord-pr" (explicit enumeration —
each board-coord name counts, missing one would let two runs collide), minus
--self, minus anything created inside --grace. No directory or project
scoping — interactive and worktree launches are supposed to count (D11).

Failure policy: fail-closed. A missing dependency, an unreachable CLI, a
non-JSON response, an exhausted page cap, or an unreadable, empty, malformed,
or non-envelope fixture all print GATE: SKIP <reason> and exit 1 — detection
can never "rescue" itself into a start. Reasons are single sanitized tokens;
raw response bodies and credential material are never echoed.

Exit codes: 0 RUN / 1 SKIP / 2 LIVE (paired with the markers above).

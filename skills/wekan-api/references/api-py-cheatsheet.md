# `api.py` Cheatsheet

The official Python CLI shipped in the WeKan repo root: `https://github.com/wekan/wekan/blob/main/api.py`. It has the **widest and most current API coverage** — often ahead of the wiki and the generated Redoc docs. Consult it when something isn't documented elsewhere, especially for attachments, admin settings, and Trello/Jira/etc. imports.

## Big-picture caveats

- **Password-based admin login only.** `api.py` explicitly notes it does not work with LDAP or OAuth2/OIDC accounts.
- **Credentials are stored inside the file.** Users edit the top of `api.py` to set the WeKan URL, admin email, and password. This is a documented security tradeoff — do not check in edited copies.
- The CLI is a **thin wrapper**: each command maps to one or a few REST calls. Reading it is the fastest way to discover the raw HTTP shape for a given operation.

## How to use it as a reference

When you need the current URL/method for a WeKan operation:

1. Fetch `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wekan/wekan/main/api.py` (or from the pinned version tag).
2. Search for the command name (e.g. `uploadattachment`).
3. Read the function it dispatches to — you'll see the `requests` call with the exact URL path, method, headers, and body shape.

## Command inventory

Commands are grouped below by topic. Argument names are the CLI positional argument names; verify current signatures against the file.

### Miscellaneous

- `exportboardpdf BOARDID OUTPUTPATH` — PDF export
- `getcardsbycustomfield BOARDID FIELDID VALUE`

## When to reach for `api.py` directly

- The user wants the fastest possible one-off script for an operation they'll run manually — hand them `api.py` and the command name.
- You need the current URL for an operation that the wiki calls "TODO" or that has no wiki page.
- You're supporting a new-ish WeKan version and the Redoc docs are much older.

## When *not* to use `api.py`

- Long-lived server code: it stores credentials in-file.
- Environments without a Python 3 runtime.
- When the caller needs an object model (`Board.cards`, `Card.checklists`, etc.) — use `python-wekan` instead.

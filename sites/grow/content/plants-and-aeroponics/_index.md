Aeroponics grows plants with roots suspended in air, fed by a fine mist of nutrient solution rather than soil or standing water. This approach uses up to 95% less water than traditional farming and dramatically accelerates growth rates by delivering oxygen directly to the root zone. At SFF, we pair this growing method with a DevOps mindset -- treating every grow cycle as an experiment, every sensor reading as telemetry, and every harvest as a release.

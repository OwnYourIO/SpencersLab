# Aeroponics
Aeroponics is a high risk high reward endeavor. It has a couple failure modes that can cause the plants to die rapidly (clogged nozzles or power loss). But when done successfully, can impact plants' growth by up to 20%. 

Currently this site is showing off my aeroponic build, but will soon have more information around designing and building your own aeroponic system, along with tips and tricks I've learned along the way.

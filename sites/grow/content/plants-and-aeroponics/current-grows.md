Active grow cycles across SFF sites. Each trial is tracked as a discrete experiment with weekly photo updates.

## Strawberry Tower -- Low-Pressure Misting Trial

</div>

Testing a new low-pressure misting schedule with 5-second bursts every 3 minutes. Early results show comparable root mass to the high-pressure system at a fraction of the hardware cost.

## Lettuce Cultivar Comparison

Comparing growth rates, tip burn susceptibility, and final yield weight across five cultivars under identical conditions.

## Mixed Herb Tower -- Curated Forest Algorithm

</div>

Running the Curated Forest polyculture algorithm with basil, cilantro, mint, and parsley. The system adjusts nutrient ratios based on aggregate uptake patterns.

At any given time, SFF sites are running multiple concurrent grow cycles across different tower configurations and plant species. Current trials include a high-density lettuce run comparing five cultivars under identical nutrient profiles, a strawberry tower stress-testing a new low-pressure misting schedule, and a mixed herb tower running the Curated Forest polyculture algorithm. Each grow is tracked as a discrete experiment with a defined hypothesis, controlled variables, and success metrics logged in the repository. Weekly progress photos, sensor summaries, and yield measurements are published here as the cycles progress. When a grow completes, the full dataset is archived in TimescaleDB and a retrospective documents what worked, what surprised us, and what changes carry forward into the next cycle.

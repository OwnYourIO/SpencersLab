Transparency is a core principle at SFF, and that extends to our sensor telemetry. This page embeds live Grafana dashboards from active grow sites, showing real-time environmental conditions as they happen. You can watch root zone temperature, ambient humidity, nutrient EC, pH levels, and light intensity update every few seconds. Historical views are available for the past 24 hours, 7 days, or full grow cycle. The data is unfiltered -- you will see the spikes when a door opens, the dips when a reservoir refill dilutes the nutrient solution, and the overnight temperature swings that the automation system works to smooth out. All of this data feeds back into the optimization loop that makes each successive grow better than the last. If you are running your own SFF-compatible setup, you can connect your site's telemetry to the shared dashboard and benchmark against the community.

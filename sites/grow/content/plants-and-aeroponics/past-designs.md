Every iteration of the SFF aeroponic system taught us something the datasheets never mentioned. Below is a visual history of how the hardware evolved.

## V1 -- PVC Tower Prototype

The first prototype proved the concept but had no instrumentation beyond a kitchen timer. Root zone conditions were a complete mystery.

## V2 -- High-Pressure Nozzles + First Sensors

Adding sensors immediately revealed that spray intervals were too long and roots were drying out between cycles.

## V3 -- Modular Panel Design

<div class="gallery">

{{< figure src="/images/designs/v3-complete.jpg" caption="Completed V3 installation with full TechnoCore sensor suite." >}}

</div>

The modular design can be flat-packed and shipped. Each of these designs still runs at various test sites.

Every iteration of the SFF aeroponic system has taught us something the datasheets never mentioned. The first prototype was a simple PVC tower with a submersible pump and off-the-shelf misting nozzles -- it worked well enough to prove the concept, but clogged constantly and had no instrumentation beyond a kitchen timer. Version two introduced high-pressure nozzles, a proper accumulator tank, and the first ESPHome sensor nodes, which immediately revealed that our spray intervals were far too long and the root zone was drying out between cycles. The third generation moved to a modular panel design that could be flat-packed and shipped, with integrated drip trays and quick-connect plumbing. Each of these designs still runs at various test sites, and the performance data they generate continues to inform the current architecture. We keep full build documentation, CAD files, and bill-of-materials for every past version in the repository so anyone can reproduce or remix them.

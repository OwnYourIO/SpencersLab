Every iteration of the SFF aeroponic system taught us something the datasheets never mentioned. Below is a visual history of how the hardware evolved.

## V1 -- PVC Tower Prototype

{{< figure src="" caption="The original PVC tower with submersible pump and off-the-shelf misting nozzles. Simple, effective, and constantly clogging." >}}

The first prototype proved the concept but had no instrumentation beyond a kitchen timer. Root zone conditions were a complete mystery.

## V2 -- High-Pressure Nozzles + First Sensors

{{< figure src="" caption="Version two introduced high-pressure nozzles, an accumulator tank, and the first ESPHome sensor nodes." >}}

Adding sensors immediately revealed that spray intervals were too long and roots were drying out between cycles.

## V3 -- Modular Panel Design

The modular design can be flat-packed and shipped. Each of these designs still runs at various test sites, and the performance data continues to inform the current architecture.

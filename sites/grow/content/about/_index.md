# About Me
I'm first a software engineer of 20 years, and second a farmer who's been playing with aeroponics personally for almost a decade, and professionally for 4 years. 

When I was looking for where I wanted to apply my time, I knew I wanted to bring some science fiction into the world and found aeroponics and indoor vertical farming to be a great way to do that. Thus SciFi Farm was born!

In addition to the physical aspects of aeroponics, I specialize in IoT & industrial automation, and how to manage the large datasets that are produced. I do offer consulting services for all of the above.

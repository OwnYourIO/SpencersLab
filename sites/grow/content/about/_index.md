Science Fiction Farms started with a simple question: what happens when you treat a farm like a software project? The answer turned out to be surprisingly productive. Founded by Spencer Hachmeister in Colorado Springs, SFF combines aeroponic growing systems with open-source IoT infrastructure to build farms that are transparent, reproducible, and continuously improving. Every sensor reading is logged, every automation rule is version-controlled, and every harvest is a data point that makes the next one better. We are not a tech company that happens to grow plants -- we are farmers who believe the best tools for the job happen to be the same ones used to run distributed systems at scale.

Spencer Hachmeister brings over a decade of experience bridging the gap between infrastructure engineering and real-world systems. From Kubernetes clusters to aeroponic towers, the same principles apply: automate the tedious parts, monitor everything, and design for failure recovery. SFF offers consulting and contracting services for organizations looking to build IoT-powered growing operations, deploy sensor networks with Home Assistant and ESPHome, or integrate time-series data pipelines with TimescaleDB and Grafana. Whether you are a research university instrumenting a greenhouse, a vertical farm scaling to production, or a hobbyist who wants their grow room to run like a well-managed server rack, we can help you get there. All work is delivered with full documentation and version-controlled configuration -- no black boxes.

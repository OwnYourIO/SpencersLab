The SFF technology stack is built entirely on open-source software. From the microcontrollers monitoring root zone humidity to the time-series databases storing years of growth data, every layer is designed to be transparent, forkable, and community-driven. We call this stack **TechnoCore** -- a curated set of tools that turn a pile of sensors and pumps into an intelligent growing system.

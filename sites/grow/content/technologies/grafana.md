Grafana is the visualization layer that turns raw time-series data into actionable insight. SFF sites use Grafana dashboards to monitor real-time conditions, spot anomalies, and track long-term trends across every grow zone. A single glance at the tower overview panel tells you which zones are thriving and which need attention -- color-coded by deviation from target ranges. Alerting rules push notifications when critical thresholds are crossed, so operators can respond before a small drift becomes a lost crop. Dashboards are stored as JSON and version-controlled alongside the rest of the TechnoCore configuration, making it easy to share proven monitoring setups across the SFF community.

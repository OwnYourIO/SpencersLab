Curated Forest is our approach to managed polyculture -- growing multiple complementary species together in a single aeroponic system, guided by data rather than guesswork. Instead of monoculture rows, each tower hosts a deliberately chosen mix of plants whose nutrient uptake, growth rate, and light requirements balance each other out. Sensor feedback continuously refines the mix ratios, and over successive growing cycles the system converges on combinations that outperform any single crop in both yield and resilience. Think of it as version-controlled biodiversity: every planting is a commit, and the data tells you whether to merge or revert.

# The Curated Forest

The Curated Forest is basically a collection of open technologies that have been evaluated and deemed functional enough to replace a more typical SaaS offering. Think of the antithesis of Apple's "Walled Garden".

It's not necessarily exclusive to farming and will eventually get it's own site too.

The current main components are:
- Home Assistant
- EspHome & the ESP chips to go along
- Postgresql & TimescaleDB
- Grafana
- 
- 



Curated Forest is our approach to managed polyculture -- growing multiple complementary species together in a single aeroponic system, guided by data rather than guesswork. Instead of monoculture rows, each tower hosts a deliberately chosen mix of plants whose nutrient uptake, growth rate, and light requirements balance each other out. Sensor feedback continuously refines the mix ratios, and over successive growing cycles the system converges on combinations that outperform any single crop in both yield and resilience. Think of it as version-controlled biodiversity: every planting is a commit, and the data tells you whether to merge or revert.
